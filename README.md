 🔢 Python NumPy Project

Welcome to the **Python NumPy** project! This repository demonstrates how to use `NumPy` for high-performance mathematical operations, array manipulation, and numerical computing.

---

 📚 What is NumPy?

**NumPy** (Numerical Python) is the core library for scientific computing in Python. It provides:

* N-dimensional arrays (ndarray)
* Vectorized operations and broadcasting
* Mathematical functions (linear algebra, statistics, etc.)
* Random number generation
* Integration with C/C++ and other scientific libraries

---

## 🧰 Features

* Efficient storage and manipulation of numerical arrays
* Element-wise operations and broadcasting
* Fast linear algebra (via BLAS/LAPACK)
* Random number capabilities with `numpy.random`
* Interoperability with other libraries like Pandas, SciPy, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, etc.

---

## 📦 Requirements

* Python 3.7+
* pip (Python package manager)

### Dependencies

```
numpy >= 1.21
```

You can install NumPy with:

```bash
pip install numpy
```

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Example: Creating Arrays

```python
import numpy as np

# Create a 1D array
a = np.array([1, 2, 3])

# Create a 2D array
b = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])

# Generate an array of zeros
z = np.zeros((2, 3))

# Generate a range of numbers
r = np.arange(0, 10, 2)
```

 Example: Array Operations

```python
x = np.array([1, 2, 3])
y = np.array([4, 5, 6])

# Element-wise addition
print(x + y)

# Dot product
print(np.dot(x, y))

# Reshape
matrix = np.arange(12).reshape(3, 4)
print(matrix)
```
